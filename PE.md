Physical and mental well being through exercise

*Description:*

This is a physical exercise class, that aims to help students to develop skills and practises that they can put to use everyday, to improve their physical and mental health. In this class, we invite guest instructors to lead us in online classes. Classes will include yoga, meditation, martial arts and other home-based activities. We invite instructors from across Canada and the world to volunteer to give one or more sessions to our students, online. There is no obligation for instructors to give more than a single session. Sessions will happen either early morning or late evening in Canada, and there is flexibility around exact timing.

Female instructors who are interested in volunteering to provide a session to our girls are invited to contact us <a href="mailto:amireson@gmail.com">here</a>.

*Learning outcomes:*

* A sense of physical and mental well-being

* Improved yoga skills

* Enjoyment of learning together
