I want to share with you one of my experiences when I was student at course.

Of course living under Taliban rules can make life dangerous and stressful. That was why we weren't able to carry on studying. We have forced to beginning a secret class until get an official permission. Unhappily there was some individuals against knowledge who never want to accept that girls are the half of society and have right to studying. They have always wanted to expose everything and kill our mental health.

One day, it was almost evening my classmates and I were busy to solving some mathematics questions and studying other subjects to become prepared for the test day. Suddenly my classmate comes in and said "Taliban came unannounced to check if there are girls in classes or not". 

All of us were shocked and scared, trying to work out how to escape from their sight. We hid behind the chairs. The only thing that I had in mind there was what is going to happen to us if they notice anything about the secrets class?

We were quiet until the door has opened. I saw the manager who couldn't stop laughing to us. He said "don't worry they have came here for checking something else. It has nothing to do with you"

Fortunately we could breathe out again. I think the manager might said that words because of us that we feel convenience. But from then on our class has cancelled for about two months. Though the class gets started again. We hadn't sufficient concentrate during the lectures and lost the excitement of studying.

Consequently it was the day that I have never forgotten. My purpose of sharing this story is to make obvious that how the situation can be unacceptable and unfair for girls in Afghanistan.
