*Description:*

In these classes students improve their English listening and speaking through conversation. We read passages from books, and discuss the meaning of different words and the meaning of the text. We focus on empowering, positive content that will improve English while also providing good strategies to cope with the difficult situation.

*Learning outcomes:*

* Improved English speaking and listening skills for confident communication

* Experience sharing and debating different ideas

* Understand different people around the world
