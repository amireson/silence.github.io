Chela Girlâ€™s Empowerment Program seeks to empower girls in Afghanistan who are deprived of education, work opportunities and freedom, to believe in themselves and their future. Our goal is to prepare the girls with English language and other skills so that they are ready to seize future opportunities for study, work or travel.
